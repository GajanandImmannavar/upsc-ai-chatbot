(For UPSC, State PSC, SSC – NCERT Base)

--------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER 1: THE RISE OF NATIONALISM IN EUROPE
--------------------------------------------------
Nationalism is a sense of collective belonging to a nation. In Europe, nationalism emerged in the 19th century due to the French Revolution and the spread of liberal ideas such as equality before law, freedom, and sovereignty.

The French Revolution (1789) introduced the concept of the nation-state. Symbols like the tricolour flag, national anthem, and centralized administration strengthened national identity.

Napoleon Bonaparte spread revolutionary ideas across Europe but also imposed authoritarian rule. His reforms like the Civil Code of 1804 abolished feudalism.

The Congress of Vienna (1815), led by Metternich, restored conservative monarchies and suppressed nationalism.

The unification of Italy was led by Mazzini, Cavour, and Garibaldi. The unification of Germany was achieved under Otto von Bismarck through wars and diplomacy.

Nationalism also led to conflicts, particularly in the Balkans, contributing to the First World War.

--------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER 2: NATIONALISM IN INDIA
--------------------------------------------------
Indian nationalism developed under British colonial rule. The First World War created new economic hardships and political awareness.

The Indian National Congress was formed in 1885. Mahatma Gandhi introduced mass movements based on truth and non-violence.

Major movements:
- Non-Cooperation Movement (1920)
- Civil Disobedience Movement (1930)
- Quit India Movement (1942)

The Rowlatt Act (1919) allowed detention without trial, leading to widespread protests. The Jallianwala Bagh massacre intensified nationalist sentiments.

The Simon Commission (1927) faced protests as it excluded Indians. The Poona Pact (1932) addressed the issue of Dalit representation.

India achieved independence on 15 August 1947 but was accompanied by Partition and communal violence.

--------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER 3: THE MAKING OF A GLOBAL WORLD
--------------------------------------------------
Globalisation refers to the integration of economies through trade, migration, and capital flow.

The pre-modern world saw global exchanges through the Silk Routes. The 19th century witnessed rapid globalisation due to industrialisation.

Colonialism reshaped global trade patterns. India became a supplier of raw materials and a market for British goods.

The Great Depression (1929) disrupted global trade and employment.

After World War II, institutions like the IMF and World Bank were established to stabilise global economies.

--------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER 4: THE AGE OF INDUSTRIALISATION
--------------------------------------------------
Industrialisation began in Britain due to availability of capital, coal, and labour.

In India, industries developed under colonial constraints. Cotton textiles, jute, and iron industries expanded.

Indian entrepreneurs like Tata and Birla played key roles.

Industrial labour faced harsh working conditions, long hours, and low wages.

Handicrafts declined due to machine-made imports but survived through adaptation.

--------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER 5: PRINT CULTURE AND THE MODERN WORLD
--------------------------------------------------
The invention of the printing press revolutionised communication.

Print culture spread ideas of nationalism, reform, and democracy.

In India, print played a role in social reform movements and the freedom struggle.

Newspapers, pamphlets, and novels shaped public opinion.

The British imposed censorship to control nationalist writings.
